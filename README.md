# delphi
Documentation for relevant repositories to LEADS.

## Notes for Developers
> [!CAUTION]
> If you would like to update the documentation of a given repo listed on `delphi`, do NOT directly edit its corresponding files within `docs`. 

As of right now, `delphi` updates every 24 hours by cURL'ing any changes within each repo's `docs` folder. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you'd like to immediately manually update `delphi` _after_ editing the documentation of the repository you're working on:
> Actions -> Update Documentation -> Run workflow
